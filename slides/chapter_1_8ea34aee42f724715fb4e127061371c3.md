`@script`
In the past lessons we discovered that anomaly detection is about looking for outliers in data. We also defined an outlier as a point that is very distant from other points.

## Global and Local outliers

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "754a939d57"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
Global Outliers

- Very High

- Very Low

- WRT all other points


`@part2`
Local outliers

- in normal range

- far from local points


`@script`
Now we'll get a little bit deeper in the definition of outlier by describing the difference between the two most important types: global and local outliers. 
As we've seen in the last chapter global outliers are points that have a very high or a very low value when compared to all the other values in a dataset. 
Local outliers, on the contrary, are points that have values within the normal range for the whole dataset but that are unusually low or high when compared to the surrounding points.
This means that the same value may not be considered an outlier in case it occurred in a different context.
